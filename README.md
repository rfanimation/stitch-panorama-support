## Features

### Panorama Stitching
Transform overlapping photos into seamless panoramas using advanced computer vision and AI depth estimation.

- **10 Projection Types** — Spherical, Cylindrical, Mercator, Panini, Little Planet, and more
- **Gigapixel Support** — Create panoramas over 100 megapixels
- **Depth-Aware Blending** — AI analyzes scene depth for smarter seam placement
- **Ghost Removal** — Automatic elimination of parallax artifacts

### Image Stacking
Stack multiple exposures for noise reduction, HDR, and moving object removal.

- **Noise Reduction** — Combine exposures to dramatically reduce noise
- **Moving Object Removal** — Median stacking removes people, cars, and birds
- **HDR Merge** — Combine bracketed exposures with Mertens or Debevec algorithms
- **Tone Mapping** — Reinhard, Drago, and Mantiuk operators for HDR processing

### Professional Export
- **JPEG, PNG, HEIF** — Standard formats for sharing

### Tips for Best Results

1. **Overlap** — Ensure 30-50% overlap between adjacent images
2. **Steady Shots** — Use a tripod or brace yourself for sharper results
3. **Consistent Lighting** — Avoid drastic exposure changes between shots
4. **3-12 Images** — Optimal range for most panoramas
